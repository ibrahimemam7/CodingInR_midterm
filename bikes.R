# start by importing the csv files into data frames
station <- read.csv("raw_data/station.csv")
trip <- read.csv("raw_data/trip.csv")
weather <- read.csv("raw_data/weather.csv")

# get an idea of what information is contained in the station dataframe
head(station)

# determine the range of the values to identify potential outliers
# summary also shows the type for each variable
summary(station)

# identify zeros or NAs
status(station)

# visualize distributions for categorical variables
freq(station)

# repeat similar steps for the trip data frame
head(trip)
summary(trip)
status(trip)
freq(trip)

#' visualize the distribution of numerical variables in the trips data frame
#' did not do this for station dataframe because there were no important numerical
#' variables (i.e. showing distribution of longitude/latitude is not helpful)
plot_num(trip)

#' it seems the previous histogram does not show the distribution of the data for
#' trip duration, likely because the range of the data is very wide. Use log.
hist(log(trip$duration))

# repeat similar steps for the weather data frame
head(weather)
summary(weather)
status(weather)
freq(weather)
